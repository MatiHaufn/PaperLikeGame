# PaperLikeGame

This is a game I started to create. It is in a paper style in a 3D world. 
I plan to create all 3D and 2D objects on my own. By now I am busy with the gameplay elements. 

It is the first time I worked with an dialog system. In this case I am using Yarn Spinner. 

# Gameplay
- Player should be able to run and jump 
- Player should be able to speak to NPCs
- Player should be able to push blocks away

My wish for this project is, that it looks nice in the end. Depending on small detailed animations like the turning animation.
